These are the files provided by Marijn Haverbeke in Chapter 5 of his (excellent) book [Eloquent Javascript](http://http://eloquentjavascript.net/), 2nd edition.

I have uploaded them to my GitHub b/c I wrote an explanation/tutorial about the recursion DNA problem and wanted to link to a static copy of the files available in case the book materials change.
